# logical
Logical is a webGL based boolean logic expression simulator.

Logical gates in the form of tiles in a grid can be
arranged on the screen and then connected as desired.
The resulting logical expression can then be evaluated
using source (true/false) tiles and result (indicating what
the output of a logic element is) tiles.
